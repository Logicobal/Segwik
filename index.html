                    <p> The biggest difference between people who OWN A BUSINESS versus people <br> who are OWNED BY THEIR BUSINESS has almost nothing to do with how good <br> your products or services are. While of course, quality is important, it's not
                        <br> what makes a company grow. It's automation and systems that make a <br> company grow - the ability to sell those products and services 24/7/365 <br> without your direct involvement that makes your company grow

                    <p>So, when you realize you have no way to handle all the new leads you paid good money for, you go back to your comfortable sticky notes and spreadsheet system, begging your staff to “Log your work into the CRM!”</p>

                        whole small business thing is for home services companies.</p>
                    <p>You want to grow and scale, but it's irritatingly elusive. Our options are limited and come with plenty of drawbacks. To get around all of that pain of growing a business, we spent years working with consultants, studying books, visiting
                        expensive seminars and making all the mistakes you could make.</p>
                    <p>And it wasn't enough to just learn theory about operations, marketing, systems and technology. You needed to practice it. And practice and practice until it became like second nature. Real world experience is what teaches you right?</p>
                    <p>It meant experimenting and trying different things. Some things worked and some things didn't. And imagine having to perfect automation and systems across your entire business. Yeah, it's tough. After all, life doesn't exactly stop
                        and wait while you learn how to build your business the right way</p>
